## What
"Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs" exercises I'm working through. 

Based on [this classic CS Textbook.](https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf) Historically, this has been the textbook used in MIT's first level CS class. 

These exercises are coded in LISP using the mit-scheme interpreter. 

## Why I'm doing this: 

This is a classic textbook that contains many concepts that are missed the first time around in a CS education. (e.g. normal-order evaluation vs applicative-order evaluation, what data actually is, etc.)

I'm fascinated by the idea of formally specifying a program mathematically such that one can prove (using math) a program is correct and free of bugs. This book shows how to do that, in addition to a number of other intriguing topics.
